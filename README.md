# Geometric-Calculator
This is a Python-based command-line application for defining and analyzing geometric shapes like points, lines, circles, and rectangles. Users can calculate properties like distances, lengths, areas, circumferences, and perimeters interactively.
Setup and Instructions




Setup and Instructions - 
Dependencies:

Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed.
No additional libraries are required as this project uses standard Python modules.
Build and Setup:
Clone or unzip the project repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_link>  
cd project_folder_name
Alternatively, unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the folder.
Run the Application:
Start the calculator:
bash
Copy code
python3 geometric_calculator.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to define shapes and perform measurements.







Assumptions and Known Issues - 
The system does not validate if shapes are truly geometric (e.g., for lines and rectangles).
Only simple commands like define and measure are implemented. Complex inputs may require additional error handling.
Currently, this application only supports 2D geometries.






Challenges Faced - 
Designing a clear, interactive command-line interface.
Managing errors effectively to provide meaningful feedback when incorrect inputs are given.
Implementing robust parsing for user commands while ensuring code readability.





Additional Notes - 
The application can be extended to support additional shapes like polygons or 3D objects.
Testing with edge cases like negative inputs or zero values helped improve validation.
